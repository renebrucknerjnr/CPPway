# Conway's game of life, implemented in C++

1. Use `space` to pause and un-pause the game.
2. Use the mouse to place cells (left click places, while right click removes).

3. Use `C` to clear the grid, and `F` to fill 45% of the grid with cells.

4. Use `T` to change the algorithm type (less than or equal to 4 neighbors will kill a cell, and more than 4 will create one).
